# Python Engineering Profile

Read [Language engineering profiles](language-profiles.md) first. This profile specializes shared Protocol 5 doctrine for Python execution and packaging. Shared architecture, testing, performance, concurrency, scientific, security, and release owners remain authoritative.

## Language-native design

Prefer Python mechanisms that keep product behavior explicit while avoiding machinery that exists only to compensate for lower-level languages.

- Prefer clear high-level functions/modules and the project's established abstractions before adding frameworks, registries, wrapper hierarchies, or dynamic metaprogramming.
- Use context managers and deterministic resource scopes when they simplify ownership of files, locks, temporary state, transactions, devices, or external resources.
- Use iterators, generators, streaming, and lazy traversal when they reduce unnecessary materialization without obscuring failure or ordering semantics.
- Use dataclasses, protocols, typed records, enums, and type annotations when they materially improve contracts and tooling; do not create a second schema/type system merely for symmetry.
- Prefer simple immutable/read-only data flow where practical. Avoid avoidable object churn, reflection, monkeypatch-oriented production architecture, and abstraction whose only effect is indirection.
- Follow the project's established error model. Exceptions are normal Python control/error propagation; do not reproduce C-style status plumbing unless a real API/boundary contract requires it.

Avoid **C++-in-Python**: manual lifetime state machines, low-level elementwise loops, thread assumptions copied from native code, bespoke ownership wrappers, or native rewrites when direct Python/library code is simpler and sufficient.

## Numerical and data-path performance

Apply the shared optimization order first.

- Keep large dense numerical work in established compiled/vectorized kernels when practical. NumPy/SciPy/framework operations count as compiled execution only when the actual path avoids scalable Python elementwise work.
- `numpy.vectorize` and `frompyfunc` are convenience interfaces, not acceleration.
- Bounded orchestration loops over fields, species, chunks, stages, sparse states, or irregular control flow are valid; do not densify a sparse/combinatorial algorithm merely to remove Python syntax loops.
- Account for dtype, shape, stride, contiguity, broadcasting, temporary arrays, Python-object dtype/boxing, copies, conversions, and FFI crossings on hot paths.
- Prefer existing compiled library primitives before JIT/native/custom kernels when they satisfy the scientific and deployment contract.
- Escalate to Numba/JIT, Cython-like compilation, a native extension, or a custom C++ kernel only when a remaining representative bottleneck justifies the build/package/boundary complexity.

An API that looks vectorized is not performance evidence. Measure the owning end-to-end path before claiming speedup.

## Interpreter/runtime and concurrency

Do not assume one universal Python threading model.

- Derive concurrency from the actual supported interpreter/runtime mode. Traditional GIL-constrained CPython, free-threaded CPython, alternative interpreters, and native extensions can expose different thread semantics.
- When a GIL is active, threads are appropriate for I/O, shared-read orchestration, or dominant native kernels that release it; Python-bytecode-bound CPU work may need processes or a compiled realization when that is cheaper overall.
- When free-threading is active, ordinary shared-state synchronization and extension compatibility become explicit correctness concerns; do not assume all installed extensions are free-thread-safe merely because the interpreter build is.
- Use asynchronous/event-loop execution for high-concurrency I/O or event-driven workloads when it reduces thread/process complexity and matches project architecture. Do not spread async through synchronous numerical code without a material need.
- Use processes for isolation, independent address spaces, external executables, or actual runtime constraints. Account for startup, serialization, duplicated memory, shared-memory lifetime, and IPC.
- Distributed-memory/MPI execution is an architecture capability, not a C++ feature. Use the project-appropriate Python MPI/runtime interface when distributed execution is Frozen.
- Model nested execution explicitly: Python workers/threads/async tasks can call BLAS, FFT, OpenMP, framework, MPI, or accelerator runtimes. Do not let each layer independently claim the full allocation.

## Effective resources

Use effective allocation from the shared performance owner. `os.cpu_count()` or similar host counts are only hints and must not override a smaller scheduler, affinity, cgroup/container, or explicit user allocation.

For long-running orchestration, keep worker counts overrideable and preserve a bounded serial/debug path when the product can support one cleanly.

## Tools and validation

Use shared relation-first tool routing, then select Python-appropriate evidence.

- Serena remains appropriate for supported semantic symbol/reference questions; Semgrep for supported structural families; CodeQL for supported interprocedural flow.
- Broad/combinatorial Python input or state invariants route to [Hypothesis](tool-hypothesis.md) when available and materially useful.
- Runtime state/crash questions may use `pdb`/debugpy-class debuggers or project equivalents.
- Allocation/resource questions may use `tracemalloc`, allocation/memory profilers, or framework/runtime metrics appropriate to the claim.
- CPU bottlenecks may use Python/sampling profilers plus native/backend profiling when time is spent below Python.
- Concurrency tests must reflect the actual interpreter/runtime mode; a passing GIL-constrained test does not establish free-threaded safety.

Exact tool identity remains delegated. Tool absence never relaxes the engineering claim.

## Packaging and native boundaries

Preserve the project's supported interpreter/package/import/environment contract.

- Test installed/package import paths when release behavior depends on them rather than accepting source-tree imports alone.
- For native extensions, include compiler/runtime/library compatibility, extension loading, wheel/package contents, and supported interpreter threading mode where material.
- Across Python/C++ boundaries, follow the mixed-boundary rules in the router: explicit ownership/lifetime, copy/stride semantics, exception translation, runtime-lock/GIL behavior, callback/thread ownership, batching, and packaged integration.
- Generated bindings remain derived unless deliberately governed as source.

## Review challenge

For materially affected Python code ask:

1. Is the implementation using Python's high-level/library strengths instead of reproducing another language's compensating machinery?
2. Is dominant numerical work kept out of scalable Python-level loops when an equally simple compiled primitive exists?
3. Does concurrency match the actual interpreter/runtime and nested-library behavior rather than a universal GIL assumption?
4. Did a JIT/native/binding/async/process layer earn its integration and maintenance cost?
5. Would a simpler Python-native realization satisfy the same product/Frozen contract with equal or better performance fitness?

These are engineering questions, not style gates. Equivalent stylistic preferences without material correctness, performance, ownership, or maintenance effect do not block acceptance.
